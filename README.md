# Hospital Readmission Prediction for Diabetic Patients

## Overview

This repository contains the coursework for COMP0189 - Applied Artificial Intelligence, focusing on the prediction of hospital readmissions for diabetic patients. The project encompasses a comprehensive analysis of a dataset describing patient encounters over ten years, which includes pre-processing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. The repository is structured to guide through various tasks from dataset description to proposing alternative machine learning pipelines and identifying potential solutions for limitations encountered.

## Repository Structure

- `COMP0189_CW1_HVWM7.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis, pre-processing, machine learning model development, and evaluation.
- `COMP0189__001Coursework1_HVWM7_Report.pdf`: Detailed report outlining the methodology, results, and interpretations of the analyses conducted, along with discussions on limitations and potential improvements.

## Key Components

1. **Dataset Description**: Insight into the dataset used for the project, highlighting the challenges such as missing values, data imbalance, and the need for high domain knowledge for feature interpretation.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps taken to prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values, feature selection, and encoding strategies to deal with categorical data.

3. **Model Development**: Development of a machine learning pipeline using models like LinearSVC, RandomForestClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier. The section includes a discussion on model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation strategies.

4. **Evaluation and Interpretation**: Analysis of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This section also delves into model interpretation through feature importance and other techniques to understand the influence of various features on readmission prediction.

5. **Alternative Approaches**: Exploration of Nested Cross-validation as an alternative approach to enhance model performance and address data imbalance, alongside a discussion on its implementation and benefits.

6. **Limitations and Future Work**: Identification of limitations within the dataset and the modeling approach, with suggestions for future research directions to overcome these challenges.
